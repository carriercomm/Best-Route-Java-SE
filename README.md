A graph optimization problem in the form of a grid of horizontal and vertical lines, on which a motorist can drive. He wants to find the most profitable routes for him according to different criteria (cost, duration, contribution of both). One part is to calculate the fastest and the cheapest routes, respecting the speed limits. The second part is: the driver wants to make the trip in a less time than with the fastest route. In order to do this, he will have to drive faster than permitted, thus possibly paying fines for speeding. The objective will be to minimize the expected cost of the trip. Visualization of the results. Language: Java (SE); technologies: JUnit, Swing, AWT, JMathTools, JXL, jdom; IDEs: Eclipse, NetBeans
